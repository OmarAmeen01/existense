    <h2 className='font-sans text-2xl  min-[676px]:text-3xl font-[600] my-8 '>The Present</h2>
    <p className='min-[676px]:text-lg font-sans'>
    Today, we are witnessing unprecedented challenges in education. Millions of students globally lack access to quality learning resources or personalized guidance. This gap is further widened by a shortage of skilled educators, making it increasingly difficult for schools and institutions to scale their impact. If we want to ensure a brighter future for every student, we need more inclusivity and personalized engagement — and this means leveraging intelligent automation and technology.

    <h2 className='font-sans text-2xl  min-[676px]:text-3xl font-[600] my-8 '>The Possibility</h2><p className='text-lg font-sans '>
    We are in the early stages of a revolution in AI, and this presents an extraordinary opportunity to redefine how we learn and teach. In education, this transformation promises to enhance both the accessibility and quality of learning, creating a future where personalized and scalable education becomes the norm.
            </p>
            <p className='min-[676px]:text-lg font-sans mt-7'>
            As AI integrates into the education sector, the traditional one-size-fits-all model will evolve. Intelligent educational platforms like us, designed to think, learn, and respond to students' unique needs, can deliver tailored learning experiences better than conventional methods. Today, the cost of education is heavily influenced by manual teaching efforts, including teacher salaries and administrative overhead, which account for a significant share of global education spending. However, as AI-powered platforms “join the teaching workforce,” they will reduce these costs by offering scalable, high-quality instruction that is accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p className='min-[676px]:text-lg font-sans mt-7'>
            Over time, these intelligent systems could handle repetitive tasks like grading, curriculum design, and progress tracking, allowing human educators to focus on mentorship and fostering creativity. Eventually, AI-powered platforms could even take on the full spectrum of teaching responsibilities, ensuring every child receives a personalized education that adapts to their learning style and pace.
            </p>
            <p className='min-[676px]:text-lg font-sans mt-7'>
            This shift could bring an abundance of affordable, high-quality educational resources to every corner of the world. With Misty at the forefront, the possibilities are vast: a future where education is no longer limited by geography, affordability, or resource availability. This revolution can democratize learning and empower the next generation with knowledge, skills, and opportunities that were previously out of reach.
